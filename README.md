# MVP-Internship
The concepts learnt from my internship were:
1. **Data warehousing using SSIS** : Identify the fact and dimension tables, extract the data from Source (Excel), transform and Load the data to destination (dimension and a fact tables).
2. **Build Reports Using SSRS** : With the structured data that's been loaded into the datawarehouse, I built reports using that data in SSRS
3. **Visualization Reports using Power BI** : Using the same data I built dashboards using Power BI and a connection was made to open SSRS reports from Power BI.
